# Virtual Storage RAID Lab
Tech Stack : RAID Storage Virtualization

## Objective
Build a production-grade Linux image capable of:

* Booting under QEMU/KVM
* Supporting SSH access
* Being exposed as a host block device via qemu-nbd
* Participating in a software RAID1 mirror using mdadm
* Successfully booting as a RAID-backed virtual machine

## Host Environment

Recommended Host OS:

Debian 13 (Trixie)

Required Packages:

Refer to the PACKAGEs list under file: `./bootstrap/preinstall_host.sh`
